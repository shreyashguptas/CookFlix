Models/
Contains the data structures and business logic
Represents the core data types of your application
Files:
Recipe.swift: Defines the structure of a recipe
Ingredient.swift: Defines what makes up an ingredient
MeasurementUnit.swift: Enum for different measurement units (cup, tbsp, etc.)
Views/
Contains all SwiftUI view files
Responsible for the UI presentation
Files:
ContentView.swift: Main view/home screen showing recipe list
AddRecipeView.swift: Form for adding new recipes
RecipeDetailView.swift: Detailed view of a single recipe
RecipeRowView.swift: Individual row item in the recipe list
ViewModels/
Connects Models and Views
Handles business logic and data transformation
Files:
RecipeListViewModel.swift: Manages the list of recipes
AddRecipeViewModel.swift: Handles the logic for adding new recipes
Root Level
CookFlixApp.swift: Entry point of the application
Uses @main attribute
Sets up the initial view (ContentView)
3. Architecture Pattern (MVVM)
Your project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern:
Model (Models/)
Pure data structures
Business logic
Data validation rules
View (Views/)
UI components
User interaction
Observes ViewModels for changes
ViewModel (ViewModels/)
Data preparation for views
Business logic
State management
Communication between Model and View
4. Data Flow Example
Let's take adding a recipe as an example:
User interacts with AddRecipeView
AddRecipeViewModel processes the input
Creates a new Recipe model
Updates RecipeListViewModel
Changes reflect in ContentView
This structure follows the principles of:
Separation of concerns
Single responsibility
Clean architecture
Data binding (using SwiftUI's property wrappers like @StateObject, @ObservedObject)
